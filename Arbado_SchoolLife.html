        <h2>School Life</h2>
        <h3>Pre-School</h3>
		<p>In my Pre-School days, it was filled with Exploration and Creativity. The environment in Manila, the colorful walls in our classrooms, and plenty of toys and coloring materials. I still remember the days when our teacher was telling us stories from children's books, sometimes they were scary and frightening, and sometimes they were full of joy and laughter. This was the time where I learned how to share my stuff and make some friends.</p>
        <h3>Kindergarten</h3>
		<p>I excelled during this time, I really enjoyed the activities we did, the fun memories I've experienced, and the memorable graduation pictorial.</p>
		<h3>Elementary</h3>
		<p>Elementary School was a memorable time, the subjects like Math, Science, and English had became more challenging. The unforgetable memories during field trips were the highlight that expanded my understanding of the world beyond the classroom.
        <p>The Friendships that grew a deeper bond, the importance of participating in group projects and team sports like the Intramurals. Some challenges came across my path too, such as poor time management, wrong decision making, and the pressure in academics. But in the end these experiences taught me to be resilient and to adapt to certain environments that I'm not used to.</p>
		<h3>Junior High School</h3>
	    <p>Junior High School was the time of growth and self-discovery. I faced increased academic expectations, which pushed me  to develop better time management and studying skills. The subjects we had became more complicated, and also I found a passion for specific areas, particularly in Music.</p>
        <p>Socially, this stage was very quick and swift, with me being with different friend groups. Also extracurricular activities became more diverse with opportunities, like Rondalla Worshops, Songwriting Contests, Acting competitions, etc. I learned the importance of balance between Academics, Social Life, and Personal Interests.</p>
        <p>My journey through these stages of my life was marked by growth and challenges, a transition from playing to serious learning preparing myself for the next phases of my education.</p>
